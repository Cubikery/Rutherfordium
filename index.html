        <p>Our objective for this project was to design, develop and manufacture the fastest miniature F1 car at the Saint Kentigern College STEM Racing in Schools competition, <br>
            >in addition to creating the best presented portfolios and trade display. <br>
            achieve this goal, we must incorporate innovation in both design and engineering, while also meeting all the technical criteria outlined in the guidelines.
            <br>Specific - design and manufacture a STEM Racing car that meets the regulations and has a race time of xx seconds
            <br>Measureable - secure at least $1,500 in sponsorships
            <br>Achievable - Use clear team roles, weekly planning meetings, and expert feedback to meet all technical and documentation requirements within project deadlines.
            <br>Relevant - Enhancing our STEM design and teamwork skills through this SKC comp.
            <br>Time-bound -  complete testing, documents and presentations by the 13th of June.
